# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Rate Limit Monitor Thread

## Problem: Deadlock in Global Sleep Mode

### The Bug
When all GitHub API tokens are exhausted:
1. `TokenManager.get_token()` sets `global_sleep_mode = True`
2. All worker threads in `process_repository()` call `GitHubClient._make_request()`
3. `_make_request()` checks `global_sleep_mode` and returns `None` immediately
4. Worker threads complete their repos and return empty results
5. Main loop checks `if token_manager.global_sleep_mode:` **AFTER** processing results
6. **BUT** by this time, all workers are stuck in an infinite loop:
   - They keep trying to process repos
   - Every request is skipped (returns None)
   - They never actually complete
   - The condition to call `sleep_and_reset()` is never reached
7. **DEADLOCK**: Scraper hangs indefinitely with "Global sleep mode active, skipping request" logs

### Evidence from Logs
```
2025-10-28 20:23:23 - DEBUG - [ThreadPoolExecutor-0_7] - Global sleep mode active, skipping request
2025-10-28 20:23:23 - DEBUG - [ThreadPoolExecutor-0_7] - Global sleep mode active, skipping request
2025-10-28 20:23:23 - DEBUG - [ThreadPoolExecutor-0_7] - Global sleep mode active, skipping request
... (repeated thousands of times)
2025-10-28 20:24:13 - DEBUG - [WatchdogThread] - üîç Watchdog: Progress detected (4796/6190)
2025-10-28 20:26:13 - WARNING - [WatchdogThread] - ‚ö†Ô∏è Watchdog: No progress for 2 minutes (4796/6190)
... (stuck forever)
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue is **timing and coordination**:

1. **Race Condition**: When `global_sleep_mode` is set to True, there's no guarantee any thread will call `sleep_and_reset()`
2. **Circular Wait**: Worker threads wait for `global_sleep_mode` to be False, but it can only be reset by calling `sleep_and_reset()`, which workers can't call because they're inside the executor
3. **No Ownership**: No single thread "owns" the responsibility to handle global sleep mode

## Solution: Dedicated Rate Limit Monitor Thread

### Implementation
Added a **dedicated monitoring thread** that continuously checks for global sleep mode and handles the sleep/reset cycle:

```python
def rate_limit_monitor_thread(
    token_manager: 'TokenManager', 
    notifier: DiscordNotifier, 
    processed_count_ref: Dict, 
    total_repos: int, 
    stop_event: threading.Event
):
    """Monitor thread to handle global sleep mode when all tokens are exhausted"""
    logger.info("üîç Rate limit monitor thread started")
    
    while not stop_event.is_set():
        time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds
        
        if stop_event.is_set():
            break
        
        # Check if global sleep mode is active
        if token_manager.global_sleep_mode and not token_manager.sleep_in_progress:
            logger.warning("üõë Rate limit monitor detected global sleep mode, initiating sleep...")
            processed_count = processed_count_ref.get('count', 0)
            token_manager.sleep_and_reset(notifier, processed_count, total_repos)
    
    logger.info("‚úì Rate limit monitor thread stopped")
```

### Key Features
1. **Independent Execution**: Runs in its own thread, not blocked by worker threads
2. **Fast Detection**: Checks every 5 seconds for `global_sleep_mode` flag
3. **Immediate Response**: Calls `sleep_and_reset()` as soon as exhaustion is detected
4. **Thread Safety**: Uses `sleep_in_progress` flag to prevent duplicate sleep calls
5. **Clean Shutdown**: Respects `stop_event` for graceful termination

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Rate Limit Monitor Thread (Line ~957)
```python
def rate_limit_monitor_thread(...):
    # Monitors global_sleep_mode flag every 5 seconds
    # Immediately calls sleep_and_reset() when exhaustion detected
```

#### 2. Updated Main Function to Start Monitor (Line ~1043)
```python
# Start rate limit monitor thread
rate_monitor = threading.Thread(
    target=rate_limit_monitor_thread,
    args=(token_manager, notifier, processed_count_ref, len(repositories), stop_threads),
    daemon=True,
    name="RateLimitMonitor"
)
rate_monitor.start()
logger.info("üîç Rate limit monitor thread started")
```

#### 3. Removed Manual Sleep Call from Main Loop (Line ~1135)
**Before:**
```python
if token_manager.global_sleep_mode:
    logger.warning("üõë Global sleep mode detected, initiating sleep period...")
    token_manager.sleep_and_reset(notifier, processed_count, len(repositories))
```

**After:**
```python
# Note: Global sleep mode is now handled by rate_limit_monitor_thread
```

#### 4. Updated Thread Cleanup (Line ~1165)
```python
# Stop monitor threads
stop_threads.set()
rate_monitor.join(timeout=5)
watchdog.join(timeout=5)
logger.info("‚úì Monitor threads stopped")
```

## How It Works

### Normal Operation Flow
1. Worker threads process repositories
2. Tokens are used and rotated
3. Rate limit monitor checks every 5 seconds (sees `global_sleep_mode = False`)
4. Everything continues normally

### Rate Limit Exhaustion Flow
1. Last available token is exhausted
2. `TokenManager.get_token()` sets `global_sleep_mode = True`
3. **Within 5 seconds**, rate limit monitor detects the flag
4. Monitor thread calls `token_manager.sleep_and_reset(notifier, processed_count, total_repos)`
5. `sleep_and_reset()` uses double-check pattern:
   - Checks if another thread is already handling it
   - Sets `sleep_in_progress = True`
   - Sends Discord notification
   - Sleeps for 1 hour
   - Resets all tokens
   - Sets `global_sleep_mode = False` and `sleep_in_progress = False`
6. Worker threads resume making requests

### Worker Thread Behavior During Sleep
- Worker threads continue calling `_make_request()`
- Each request immediately returns `None` (no API call made)
- Repos complete with empty results
- Executor continues processing remaining repos
- **No deadlock** because monitor thread handles the sleep independently

## Testing Verification

### Expected Behavior
1. Run scraper with limited tokens
2. Monitor logs for "All tokens exhausted, enabling global sleep mode"
3. Within 5 seconds, should see "Rate limit monitor detected global sleep mode, initiating sleep..."
4. Discord notification: "‚è∏Ô∏è Rate limit reached"
5. Sleep for 1 hour (or configured duration)
6. Discord notification: "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming scraping"
7. Scraper continues processing

### Log Patterns (Success)
```
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è All tokens exhausted, enabling global sleep mode
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - WARNING - üõë Rate limit monitor detected global sleep mode, initiating sleep...
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è All 20 tokens exhausted! Sleeping for 3600s (1 hour)...
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - INFO - üò¥ Sleeping for 3600 seconds...
... (1 hour passes) ...
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - INFO - ‚úì Sleep period ended, resetting tokens...
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - INFO - ‚úì All tokens reset, resuming scraping...
```

### Log Patterns (Failure - Old Bug)
```
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è All tokens exhausted, enabling global sleep mode
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - DEBUG - Global sleep mode active, skipping request
2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX - DEBUG - Global sleep mode active, skipping request
... (repeats forever, no sleep, no resume) ...
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Worker Threads**: Process repositories, make API calls
- **Rate Limit Monitor**: Handle global rate limit exhaustion
- **Watchdog Thread**: Detect hangs and lack of progress
- Each thread has one clear responsibility

### 2. Reliability
- No race conditions in sleep trigger
- Guaranteed response to exhaustion (5-second max delay)
- Double-check pattern prevents duplicate sleeps
- Graceful shutdown on completion

### 3. Observability
- Clear log messages for each state transition
- Discord notifications for sleep start/resume
- Watchdog still monitors for true hangs
- Easy to diagnose issues from logs

### 4. Maintainability
- Simple, focused monitor function
- No complex coordination logic
- Easy to test in isolation
- Clear ownership of sleep responsibility

## Configuration

### Monitoring Interval
```python
time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds
```
- **Trade-off**: Lower = faster response, higher = less CPU overhead
- **Recommendation**: 5 seconds is good balance (max 5-second delay to detect)

### Sleep Duration
```python
RATE_LIMIT_SLEEP = 3600  # 1 hour in seconds
```
- Configured in main configuration section
- Standard GitHub rate limit reset is 1 hour
- Can be reduced for testing

## Comparison with Previous Fixes

### Previous Approach (BUGFIX_GLOBAL_SLEEP_MODE.md)
- ‚ùå Relied on main loop to call `sleep_and_reset()`
- ‚ùå Required futures to complete before sleep triggered
- ‚ùå Workers could get stuck in infinite skip loop
- ‚ùå Race condition between setting flag and calling sleep

### Current Approach (THIS FIX)
- ‚úÖ Dedicated thread monitors for exhaustion
- ‚úÖ Independent of worker thread completion
- ‚úÖ Fast detection (5-second polling)
- ‚úÖ No race conditions
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed sleep trigger

## Deployment Notes

### Before Deployment
1. Ensure `.env` has all 20 GitHub tokens configured
2. Verify Discord webhook URL is set
3. Test with small repository set first
4. Monitor logs for proper sleep/resume cycle

### After Deployment
1. Check logs for "Rate limit monitor thread started"
2. Verify scraper progresses normally
3. When exhaustion occurs, confirm:
   - Sleep notification within 5 seconds
   - 1-hour sleep completes
   - Resume notification appears
   - Scraping continues

### Monitoring
- Watch for "Rate limit monitor detected global sleep mode"
- Verify no "Global sleep mode active, skipping request" spam
- Confirm progress resumes after sleep
- Check Discord notifications align with logs
